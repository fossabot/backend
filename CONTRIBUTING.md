## Branching Structure

Our branching structure is based on
[Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).

* **master** will always contain the code for the latest production release
* **develop** will contain the latest beta version used for testing
* **feature/*** will contain single issues being developed. Once developed they're merged into develop and tagged with
  a beta release version. They should be named 'feature/22-some-brief-description'
* **release/*** will contain all the code from each feature branch that are going out in the next release and should
  all be merged into the branch. Once approved and tested it gets merged into master and tagged. They should be named
  'release/4.1.1'
* **hotfix/*** will contain hotfixes going to be merged directly into master then tagged. Hotfixes should only need to
  occur when there is a very critical bug in the current release that needs to be fixed ASAP. All hotfix branches should
  be branched off of master

All tags are done on the **master** branch only and should be in format **v(version number)**. Most versioning and
tagging is done automatically, so please check before doing so manually.

All develop releases should be versioned as **beta** versions. For instance **4.1.1-beta.15**.

Feature branches are deleted once in a release branch. Any issues that come up after the features branch has been merged
nto a release branch should be resolved by creating a new feature branch off the release branch.

An example of a good name for a feature branch is say there is an issue (#44) which is about not being able to delete a
pack. A good name for a feature branch would be `feature/44-unable-to-delete-packs` and go from there.

## Styling Best Practices

When committing code or documentation, please ensure that you follow our set out
[style guide](https://github.com/ATLauncher/style-guide).

## Issue and Pull Request Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests. While some labels are not
available in older repositories, most public repositories will use these conventions for labels.

[GitHub search](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) makes it easy to use labels for finding groups of
