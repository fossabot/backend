## Development

If you wish to develop with this repository, please read the following sub sections.

### Installation

Before you begin you need to make sure you have the NodeJS 8 or newer installed on your computer.

**NOTE:** This repository is **NOT** compatible with Yarn. Please don't attempt to use Yarn. Support will not be given
with Yarn.

You will also want to make sure you've setup your system for NodeGyp by following their
[install docs](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation) for your system.

Clone the repository and run the following commands under your project root:

```shell
npm install
```

Once done you need to run the migrations. In development mode (which is default) the application will use a sqlite
database at `/db/development.sqlite3`.

To run the migrations simply run:

```shell
npm run migrate
```

Once done you can start the development server by running:

```shell
npm run dev
```

### Testing

To run the tests simply run the following command:

```shell
npm test
```

You can run `npm run test:clean` which will remove the test database, run the migrations as well as the seeds.

### Linting

Please make sure you run all your code through the linter before creating a pull request as all pull requests are
automatically checked by the CI process and will cause delays if not linted properly.

To run the linter:

```shell
npm run lint
```

### Database changes

When making any changes that require database schema changes, these must be done through the use of migrations.

Migrations are meant to be run only once, and make the changes needed to the database while also providing a way to
rollback those changes.

To create a new migration, run the following:

```shell
node ./node_modules/knex/bin/cli.js migrate:make name_of_migration
```

The name of your migration should describe what it does. For instance when adding a new table called 'messages' it
should be `create_messages_table`. And when changing a table it should be something like
`change_type_of_name_field_in_messages_table`.

All migrations should correctly roll back tables to their original state or remove tables/fields added.

Once a migration is written, it should **NEVER** be modified. Any modifications to migrations can cause data issues.

**NOTE**: Migration files will constantly be changing during initial development, so do not rely on them functioning as
proper migrations until the **feature/initial-code** branch has been merged into the **develop** branch.

## Configuration

All configuration files can be found in the `/config` folder.

They're divided up into 5 main files:

* `default.json`: This file is the very base file and contains configuration that is used as defaults in all
  environments unless overwritten by below files.
* `test.js`: This file contains setting overrides for when in test.
* `development.json`: This file contains setting overrides for when in development.
* `production.json`: This file contains setting overrides for when in prodution.
* `local.json`: This file contains setting overrides for all environments and should be gitignored or dynamically
  populated with a system like Ansible.

Configuration can be specified as either a `json` file, `js` file or as environment variables. For more information on
the configuration files see the [node-config](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config) repository.

## Running in production

To run in production you should use some tool such as NodeMon or Forever to keep your server up and running all the
time.

First thing you need to do is run the migrations for the production environment:

```shell
NODE_ENV=production npm run migrate
```

This will run the migrations on the defined production database specified in `/knexfile.js` which by default is set to
use MySQL using the credentials in the production config.

Then once ready to run simply run:

```shell
NODE_ENV=production npm start
```

This will compile all the src files with babel and then run the server.

## Docker builds

To build an image with Docker, simply run the following:

```shell
docker build -t atlauncher/backend-next .
```

Then to run:

```shell
docker run -p 8080:8080 atlauncher/backend-next
```
