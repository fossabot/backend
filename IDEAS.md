# Ideas

This file contains a bunch of ideas and things that may be nice to have implemented into this
repository.

## np

A better version of `npm publish` used to ensure tests pass and dependencies work. Also pushes tags
(with correct tags on publish) and might be nice to use.

## vantage

Add a CLI to the application. Good for being able to debug live running server, clear caches/queues
etc.

## axios

http request library. Alternative to something like `request`.

## pretty-bytes

Converts bytes into human readable format. Such as `1337` => `1.34 kB`.
