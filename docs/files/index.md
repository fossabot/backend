## Versions

This API is versioned so that you can ensure that your consuming applications will not have to worry about breaking
changes causing issues.

You can specify the version of the API you wish to use by providing an **Accept** header in your API calls like below:

```text
Accept: application/vnd.atlauncher.v1+json
```

By default if no Accept header is sent, we will always use the latest version of the API. If you wish to ensure
stability of your applications using this API, then it's highly recommended to set this header so that things don't
suddenly stop working one day.

### Version lifecycle

Each version of the API will **NEVER** introduce any breaking changes. This includes removing endpoints, changing return
types, removing return values and more.

Below is a simple table showing what we will and will not do in a single version of this API.
