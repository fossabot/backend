# Roles
Roles are a way to provide different users with one or many roles.

Roles are used in ATLauncher to control access to parts of the system depending on if the user has a role.

## Example
One example is a large amount of routes are restricted to users with the `admin` role. The `admin` role is a role given to ATLauncher staff and indicate their ability to administer the system.
